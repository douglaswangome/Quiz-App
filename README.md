# Quiz-App
- A quiz application using React.js, Typescript and Tailwind.css.
- The application consumes data(the questions) from Open Trivia Database API.
- The application compares the user answer with the correct answer and adds the score if the user is right.

## Tailwind-css
- Usind Tailwind I was able to create a simple UI which displays the questions from the api and gets the user choice from the user.
- The application also has a "modal" which slides in after every question notifying the user if the answer he picked was right or wrong.
- The application is also responsive.
